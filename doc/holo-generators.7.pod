=head1 NAME

holo-generators - dynamically generate files for other plugins

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generators are executable files placed under 
F</usr/share/holo/generators>.
Holo will execute generators in lexical order before asking plugins
to scan their files.
Upon execution of a generator the environment variable C<$OUT> is 
passed to it.
Unless for caching purposes generators MUST only write to the 
directory specified by C<$OUT>.
The structure under C<$OUT> is the same as for static files under
F</usr/share/holo/>.
For example to generate files for the holo-files plugin a generator 
MAY place files at F<$OUT/files>.

Generated files placed under C<$OUT> and static files under 
F</usr/share/holo/> will be made available for plugins, 
while generated files take precedence over static files.
This means if a generator places a file at 
F<$OUT/files/20-webserver/etc/nginx/nginx.conf>
the plugin holo-files will only see this file insteadof the file at
F</usr/share/holo/files/20-webserver/etc/nginx/nginx.conf>.

Files that have been written to C<$OUT> will be preserved between 
runs.
A generator MAY decide wether to overwrite existing files or not
this includes files written by other generators.
It is RECOMMENDED that generators only regenerate files if an output
different from the previous run is expected. 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
this document are to be interpreted as described in 
L<RFC 2119|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119>.
